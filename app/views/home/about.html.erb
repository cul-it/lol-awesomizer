<h2>About the Raspberry Pi</h2>
<p>Raspberry Pi is a tiny low cost
computer capable of doing all
the tasks of a desktop machine.
The small size and ease of
customization enables the device
to be deployed in a huge number
of applications. An active
enthusiast community ensures that
new, creative ways to use the
device are always being
developed. The Raspberry Pi can
be programmed to interact with
sensors, lights, cameras, Wi-Fi,
televisions, or any number of
peripherals to create inexpensive
educational or research tools as
well as fun toys.
